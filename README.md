The Odin Project Flight Booker.
The aim of this projects is to learn how to create complex forms. I will be using many different form inputs such as radio buttons and time field. I will also be starting to use nested forms.
The app will allow a user to sumit date to search for a flight. Choose a fligt from a lsit of results. Submit their data and create a booking.
